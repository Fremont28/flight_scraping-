Los Angeles Flight Arrivals 

Los Angeles International Airport is the second busiest airport in the United States. Over 1,500 flights arrive and depart from Los Angeles everyday across the world. But what cities fly the most frequently to LAX? Is it easier to catch a flight to Los Angeles from San Diego or Seattle? 

To answer this question, we scraped two-hundred plus flights from LAX using a flight data provider tracking flights later in the evening (Monday 2/12/18) through the early morning rush (Tuesday 2/13/18). 

Our analysis reveals that San Francisco and Las Vegas offer the most frequent flights to the City of Angels with 14 departing flights. Other popular arrival points feature Honolulu (10 arrivals), Denver (10), New York City JFK (9), and San Jose (9).
